This is the first Blazor webapp I made. The focus was to learn more C# and ASP.NET and not design and UI. It was the first time I worked with async/await and a Firestore document database.

It was made for a booking system that my company has.

I did get some help setting up the connection to the Firestore document database and the homebrew login system.
